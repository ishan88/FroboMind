1) Test whether robot is moving to the two consecutive waypoints even if they are same or it skips to the
next waypoint - done skips if consecutive waypoints are same

2) Test whether multiple same waypoints are navigated multiple times or only once - done

3) detect strange turn

4) log values in log file - done

5) PID control

6) right turn ofg robot angular velocity becomes negative
7) kjeld algorithm robot is more unstable..keeps adjusting the heading while moving on the 
ab line.
8) simple algorithm this movement seems to be less
9) strange turn mostly due to adjusting of the heading using pid at the last stretch.
10)
