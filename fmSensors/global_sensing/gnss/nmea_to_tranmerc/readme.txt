The FroboMind nmea_to_tranmerc component subscribes to NMEA output from a
GNSS receiver and outputs the content of the $GPGGA message along with the
position in Transverse Mercator coordinates.

The launch directory contains an example launch file which explains the 
use of nmea_to_tranmerc including an overview of the Transverse Mercator
parameters.
